The model of Smart Contract and Check analysis 
Firstly we choose a typical smart shopping contract model as an example with the it's description and content ; secondly, with the aid of smart tools , we generates the smart contract model and description of the behavior of the contractual entity. Then, use the model verification tool SPIN to analyze and verify the model.
1.Description of Shopping Smart Contract(SSC):
Shopping_Smart_Contract( Merchant, Customer,goods_information, distribution, payment,) 
Begin 
IF goods are available 
　　　Merchant select goods to purchase 
THEN IF Merchant accept the goods_price 
　　　Merchant pay for the goods to Contract account 
　　　THEN IF Merchant confirm the information of transaction 
Merchant send the goods to Customer and SSC set the terminator=timestamp + max_time 
ELSE  The transaction failed and returned the money to customer 
IF Customer received the goods with the prescribed time 
　　　Customer send confirmation message 
THEN IF Contract received confirmation message 
Contract pay to Merchant 
ELSE 
The transaction failed and returned the money to customer 
END


After analyse of SSC,we can build a reasonable SSC model. This model contain three important roles:consumer，merchant and smart contract account.The customer is the executor of the customer process, the merchant is the executor of the merchant process, and the contract account can be understood as a trusted third party account. The smart contract account is managed by SSC as an intermediary to coordinate customer and merchant operations and it ensure that the transfer operations involved in the SSC are based on 
the status of the contract.It guarantees the fairness and reliability of the contract.
The description of SSC can also be expressed in these lines:


(1)customer-->merchant:send a shopping request
(2)merchant-->customer:confirm that you can shop
(3)customer-->merchant:confirm tshe purchased goods
(4)merchant-->customer:send goods
(5)customer-->smart contract account:send money
(6)customer-->merchant:receive the goods and confiirm the transaction
(7)smart contract account-->merchant:send money
(8)merchant-->customer:confirm the completion of transaction

According to these lines, we can clearly know the steps of SSC.
And then we would provide the code for this SSC,which can simulate the process of SSC.
